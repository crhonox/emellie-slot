//! The SNES cart, in its two shells: the American one, and the Super Famicom's, which Japan and
//! Europe shared.
//!
//! Both are drawn 4 units to the millimetre. The American cart is 136 by 88 mm, the Super
//! Famicom's 130 by 86, both 20 mm thick (Wikipedia's Game Pak infobox); the rest is measured off
//! straight-on photos of real carts. The American cart is boxy: a raised column down its middle,
//! its top standing a little proud of the ribbed panels either side, the label well open at the
//! top of the column and a deep well across its bottom. The Super Famicom's is a rounded oblong,
//! its sides rolled back into the cart, five grip slots high on each, the label wide across its
//! top with its corners round, and a ribbed slot across the cover under it. The ribs and slots
//! are relief in the face, not geometry: the sides take their colour from the face just inside
//! the outline, so a rib that reaches that far runs on round the side, as it does on the real
//! carts.
