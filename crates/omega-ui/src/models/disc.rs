//! The PlayStation disc, and the stack a game on several discs stands as.
//!
//! A disc is a thin low-poly ring: its rim cut in a couple of dozen flat walls, a hole through
//! its middle walled the same way facing into the hole, and its face one texture whose alpha
//! cuts the circle and the hole. A game on several discs stands as all of them one behind the
//! other, disc 1 in front, a gap a little wider than a disc between each, the way books stand
//! on a shelf with a little air between them.
//!
//! Every disc of a game has its own face, laid side by side in one texture, disc 1 on the left:
//! a stack is uploaded and drawn again when a label arrives exactly as a cart is. Each disc is
//! drawn with its own model, which takes its face from its own part of that texture and stands
//! in its own place behind the disc in front.
