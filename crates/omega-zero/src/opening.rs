//! The opening: Mega Man X5's NOM ENGINEER WORK SYSTEM boot screen, told about this handheld.
//! A boot that lands on the shelf fades the bootloader's logo out to black, fades the terminal
//! in, types its way through ten seconds of it, fades it back out and fades the shelf in. A
//! press cuts it short: the terminal fades out at once, then the shelf comes in, and the press
//! goes no further. Once the shelf shows through, a press ends it there and is the shelf's.
//! When the boot left a game on the shelf because its start took omega-zero down, the black
//! stays and the start notice comes up on it in place of the shelf (`start_notice`).
