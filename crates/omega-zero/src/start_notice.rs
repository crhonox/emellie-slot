//! The start notice: the opening's terminal telling the player that the last start of a game
//! took omega-zero down, naming the game, its system and the core it was started on, saying it
//! was left on the shelf rather than resumed, and how to try it another way. A boot that finds
//! the game noted as starting shows it where the shelf would first be seen: the opening's black
//! stays, in place of the shelf coming in, and the notice comes up on it; with no opening, the
//! shelf fades to black first. Its lines come up in turn, in the opening's lettering on its
//! grid. Presses are ignored until its prompt is up, so a press meant to cut the opening short
//! cannot put it away unread; then A, B or START fades it out to the shelf, on the game it
//! names, and goes no further.
