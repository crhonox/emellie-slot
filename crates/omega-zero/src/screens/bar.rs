//! The bar along the bottom of the shelf and of every menu, as flow.html draws it: an action at
//! each end and, between them over whatever is behind the bar, the keys a screen has beyond its
//! two actions shown as hints. The shelf's actions are SELECT CONTROLS and START SETTINGS, a
//! menu's B RETURN and A CONFIRM. Setting the clock on first boot has nowhere to go back to, so
//! its left action is the kit's empty one: the bar keeps its shape and offers only CONFIRM. The
//! save-state switcher over a game has B RETURN and A LOAD with nothing between them: there the
//! hints would sit on the game's screenshot, so its other keys stand on a line of their own above
//! the bar (switcher.rs). The bar comes and goes with the switcher, at once.
//!
//! The hints never move with the screens. When a slide's two ends have different actions, the
//! old ones sink out of the screen over its first half and the new ones rise into place over
//! the second, as flow/player.js does; between two menus they stay put, and the hints change at
//! halfway. The core picker swaps them the same way as it opens and closes, its ◀▶ SWAP coming
//! in between RETURN and CONFIRM with them and leaving with them.
//!
//! A cart going in takes the whole bar down out of the screen, before the cart is pulled down
//! past it into the handheld; the bar stays away while the game is on and rises back as the cart
//! comes out.
//!
//! The power menu has a menu's actions, swapped with those of the screen POWER was held on as
//! it slides in and out. The screen after its choice has none, since nothing can be pressed:
//! the whole bar sinks away with the actions it had as that screen slides in, as it does when a
//! cart goes in.
